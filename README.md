## UX
### Strategy
The objective of the site is to allow users to review past weather for a location in Ireland or obtain a weather forecast for a geographic location using coordinates.
#### User Stories
- User Goals:
  - To access the historical weather for a selected date at Dublin airport.
  - To access a 3 day weather forecast for a given location.
  - To be able to leave feedback on the app.
<br><br>
- Site Administrator Goals:
  - To give users the options to access historical weather, weather forecasts and have the option to create, read, update and delete feedback.
  - To create an application using Python with clean, resuable and commented code, utilising atomic functionality and OOP where appropriate.
  - To handle any potential errors appropriately.
  - To maintain secrecy of API key for weather data provider.

### Scope
#### Essential Content
 - The app will allow users to enter a date and receive the weather for that given day.
 - The app will allow users to enter latitude and longitude coordinates to obtain a weather forecast for that location. 
#### Optional Content
- A feedback option where users can leave their feedback on the app.
### Structure
The structure of the app was defined and mapped out on a [flow chart](views/README-files/flowchart.png). This helped define the required interactions to develop a usuable product.
### Skeleton
#### Wireframes
- **ADD
### Surface (Design)
#### Colour Scheme
- The Termcolor library was used, providing *"ANSI color formatting for output in terminal"*.
- The availalble colours are limited however the following colour schemes were used for specific terminal outputs throughout the program:
  - **Errors**: errors (invalid entries, exceptions etc.) are formatted with bold white writing on a red background.<br><br>![Error Message](views/README-files/error-message-formatting.png)
  - **Information**: information that the user should know before taking an action formatted as bold green.<br><br> ![Information Message](views/README-files/information-message-formatting.png)
  - **Data**: pertinent data points either sourced/calculated from Google Sheets or Open Weather API are formatted as bold blue.<br><br> ![Data Message](views/README-files/data-message-formatting.png)
  - **Feedback**: a message to request the user does not leave the feedback message empty in bold magenta. Although this could be deemed an app error, I felt that the white on red would be too forceful to request feedback is entered. <br><br>![Feedback Message](views/README-files/feedback-message-formatting.png)
- There are a series of screens using text art to depict titles or loading information. Different colours were selected for each one to differentiate them from the others.
  - **Title**: Displayed when the program first runs.![Title Screen](views/README-files/title-screen.png)
  - **Loading**: Displayed when the program is laoding data that may take time to load.<br><br>
  ![Loading Screen](views/README-files/loading-screen.gif)
  - **Forecast Days**: Displayed when the program is about to display the weather for a given forecast day.![Day One](views/README-files/forecast-one.png) ![Day Two](views/README-files/forecast-two.png) ![Day Three](views/README-files/forecast-three.png)
#### Imagery
- The background image was sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and was selected for exhibiting a number of different weather types in one image.
![Background Image](views/README-files/background-picture.webp)
#### Favicon
- The Favicon logo was sourced from [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) and was selected to show a dramatic weather event.![Favicon Image](views/README-files/icon.png)

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used
- Python: used extensively during project.
- Markdown: Used exclusively for README.
- HTML5: minor use when applying styling to app view.
- CSS3:minor use when applying styling to app view.<br>

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
- gspread: used to complete CRUD actions on Google Sheets.
- termcolor: used to apply foreground and background colors to terminal text.
- datetime: from the standard library, used to perform operations on date and time objects and strings.
- numpy: used to create a range of floats due to python range only returning a range of integers.
- itertools: from standard library used to iterate over list for loading animation.
- pyowm: library with classes used to manage Open Weather API calls.
- time: from the standard library used to access sleep method for pauses during pertinent points of relaying information to the user.
- os: from the standard library used to access system method to clear terminal screen at appropriate points whilst the program is running.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click âš™ Settings. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the  dropdown menu, then click Settings.
3. In the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar, click  Pages
4. Under "Build and deployment", under "Branch", use the None or Branch dropdown menu and select a publishing source.
5. Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 

The live link can be found [here.](https://johnamdickson.github.io/Portfolio-Project-2/index.html)

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/johnamdickson/Portfolio-Project-2)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/johnamdickson/Portfolio-Project-2)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```
